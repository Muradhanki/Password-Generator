## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Password-Generator/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I am tasked to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password. The app that I have written will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

To get to create a password on the web application, follow these simple steps please.

* Step 1: go to   (https://muradhanki.github.io/Password-Generator/) with your favorite web borwser.

Being a a future front-end developer, I was in need of final code to run the paswword output to the web application by using JavaScript.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
