## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Password-Generator/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I am tasked to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password. The app that I have written will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

Being a a future front-end developer, I was in need of final code to run the print the analysis to the console by using JavaScript.

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
